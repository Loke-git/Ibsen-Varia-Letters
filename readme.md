# Ibsen: Varia and Letters to CSV
## Introduction
This script was created as part of a few days' long workshop collaborating with Ruth Sander. Its purpose is to read the Ibsen varia (miscellaneous documents) files and to extract relevant data from them in conjunction with the person registry CSV. The resulting dataset is enriched with names and new IDs where this is possible.

## Note
The script does NOT automatically create new XML files that replace older ones. This was done manually.
